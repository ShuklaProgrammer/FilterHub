FilterHub - Project Name

The goal of this project is to filter list of items using search input. 

The project is deployed on the vercel:- https://filter-hub.vercel.app/

Now the File or Folder Structure of the project:-
1. Everything is added in the src folder.
2. In src folder there are three new folder created by me: components, data, pages, redux.
3. In components folder I have mycomponents and the ui folder which contains the shadcn components.
4. In data folder I have added the data.js that contains collection of 30 books.
5. In pages folder I have only 1 file that is Hone.jsx. Home.jsx will render on the home or "/" page.
6. In redux folder I have features folder and store.js file. The features folder contains two slice i.e. itemSlice.js and searchSlice.js


components/mycomponents folder have three files Item.jsx, ItemList.jsx, searchInput.jsx
Item.jsx: Represents a single item in the list.
ItemLists.jsx: Displays the list of items.
searchInput.jsx: Input field for filtering items.

And all the components added in the Home.jsx


What are the teck stack used in the project?:-
Redux, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS.


I have used the shadcn for re-using some components like button, input, pagination, table, etc.
I have used the Redux for the filteration of the listed items.
I have to Tailwind CSS for the designing of my frontend.
